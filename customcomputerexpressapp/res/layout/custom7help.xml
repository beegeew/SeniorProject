Solid State Drives are a newer technology that have become extremely popular. Instead of using magnetic disks as in Hard Disk Drives, SSDs use flash chips similar to your RAM that
allow for increased read/write speeds, as well as silent running. Since SSDs are significantly faster than HDDs, they are mostly used to store operating systems (such as Windows) to
ensure extremely fast boot times. While not necessary, SSDs can increase your computer's speed by ensuring that your operating systems runs smoothly. In addition, programs that 
are used often can be placed on the SSD to ensure fast performance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

If you want speed up important programs and your computer's boot time, select a SSD from the list.
