Internal hard drives are used as main storage in desktop PCs, workstations, and servers. Nowadays, small form factor internal hard drives are also used in consumer electronic 
products such as mp3 players and digital cameras as well. When selecting a hard drive, there are two main things to consider: speed and capacity. Budget permitting, always go for 
the fastest drive you can. Speed is measured using the RPM figure â€“ a faster rotational speed means greater performance, especially in games, but may cause greater heat and noise. 
The capacity, measured in GB (gigabytes), should depend on your own storage requirements. A higher capacity drive will invariably cost more than a lower capacity drive, so a 
balance must usually be struck between capacity and cost.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

If you plan on storing movies, music, or large files, we recommened selecting a hard drive towards the bottom of the list.
